If so, here’s how a two-passenger, one-way itinerary typically works:\n\n- Each passenger earns miles for the flight on their own FF account, if you attach that passenger’s FF number to their booking.\n- If you put only one FF number on the ticket (for both passengers), usually only that account earns miles, unless the airline supports and you use a family/pool option.\n- For codeshare or partner flights, miles are earned according to the program of the operating carrier and the FF numbers you’ve linked; sometimes you must enter the numbers in the booking to ensure credit.\n- If neither passenger has an FF number, no miles are earned.\n- Miles post after travel (often within days to weeks) and can take longer if there are any itinerary changes or refunds.\n- Tip: add the FF numbers at booking or through “manage trip” after purchase to avoid missing credit.\n\nIf you tell me the airline or FF programs involved, I can give it more precisely.', 'status': 'success'}[0m
