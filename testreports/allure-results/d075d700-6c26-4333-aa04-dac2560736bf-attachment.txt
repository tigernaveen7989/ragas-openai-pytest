INFO     pytest_logger:ironman.py:62 {'response': "When a seat or ancillary service is free for a passenger, it typically means that the airline is offering certain benefits without additional charges. Here’s what you might expect:\n\n1. **Free Seat Assignment**: If a seat is available for free, passengers may not need to pay for seat selection. This often applies to standard seats, while premium seats may still incur a fee.\n\n2. **Ancillary Services**: Some airlines may offer complimentary services like checked baggage or in-flight meals as part of a promotional offer or loyalty program.\n\n3. **Check-in Process**: If you don’t select a seat, the airline will usually assign you one during check-in, ensuring you have a place on the flight.\n\n4. **Promotional Offers**: Airlines sometimes run promotions where certain seats or services are free to attract more passengers.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check the specific airline's policies, as they can vary widely. Do you have a particular airline in mind, or are you curious about a specific type of ancillary service? 😊", 'status': 'success'}
