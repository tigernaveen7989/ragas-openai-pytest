This secures better positioning (like extra legroom) versus a standard, free assigned seat. Discounts are often temporary, so confirm at booking. If you decline, you get a complimentary assignment based on airline policy, potentially with less desirable spots (e.g., middle row).\n\n### Chargeable Ancillaries\nAncillaries like extra baggage, meals, or priority boarding are optional add-ons with fees, which can be discounted (e.g., through coupons or memberships). You pay the lowered amount to add them; otherwise, they're not included. Discounts vary by provider and may require conditions like early booking. If discounted items are paid but not used (e.g., canceled trip), refund policies depend on the airline's rules—often prorated or as per fare conditions.\n\nIf specific to an airline or scenario, provide more details for tailored advice. Airline policies can differ (e.g., Ryanair charges for seats vs. Delta's mileage discounts), so check their website or terms.", 'status': 'success'}[0m
