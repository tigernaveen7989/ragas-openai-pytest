  "When two passengers with different frequent flyer tiers are flying together, the benefits of each tier are generally applied individually, based on the status of each passenger. Here's how it typically works:\n\n1. **Separate Benefits**: Each passenger gets the benefits associated with their own tier. For example, if one passenger is a gold tier member and the other is a silver tier member, the gold member will receive all the privileges that come with gold status, such as priority boarding, extra baggage allowance, and access to lounges, while the silver member will receive the benefits tied to silver status, which might include fewer perks.\n\n2. **Check-in and Boarding**:\n   - **Gold Passenger**: They would likely receive priority check-in and boarding, even if they are traveling with someone who doesn't have the same status.\n   - **Silver Passenger**: They would board after the gold passenger and likely go through the regular check-in process, unless their travel class (like business class) gives them an upgrade in these areas.\n\n3. **Baggage Allowance**: The gold-tier passenger will likely be allowed more baggage (e.g., an extra checked bag) compared to the silver-tier passenger, whose baggage allowance is aligned with their own status.\n\n4. **Lounge Access**:\n   - **Gold Passenger**: Can access the airline’s lounge, even if they are traveling with someone who doesn't have the same tier.\n   - **Silver Passenger**: Will not be eligible for lounge access unless they are flying in a higher class (business or first class) or have a specific benefit (e.g., lounge passes).\n\n5. **Upgrades**: If upgrades are available, the gold passenger might have priority for any available upgrades (to business or first class), depending on the airline's policy. The silver passenger will be lower in priority for upgrades unless the airline offers a special policy or if they are traveling together and there are special promotions.\n\n6. **Priority Services**: Priority security lanes and other expedited services will typically apply to the gold-tier passenger, while the silver-tier passenger may have to wait in standard lines.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- **Companion Benefits**: Some airlines do offer limited companion benefits, where a passenger traveling with a higher-tier frequent flyer might get certain perks, such as access to priority check-in or a lounge, but this depends on the airline's policies and whether the companion is traveling on the same ticket or not.\n- **Travel Class**: If one of the passengers is flying in a premium cabin (business or first class), they might receive certain perks regardless of their frequent flyer tier, which could apply to both passengers.\n\nAlways check the specific airline's rules for tier benefits, as each airline has its own approach to how benefits are applied when passengers with different status levels travel together."
