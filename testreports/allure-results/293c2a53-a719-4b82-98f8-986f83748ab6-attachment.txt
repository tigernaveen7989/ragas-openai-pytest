  "For a round trip involving a single passenger with an FF# (Frequent Flyer number), the system should:\n\n1. **Verify FF#**: Ensure the FF# is valid and active in the system. This will typically involve checking the frequent flyer account associated with the number for eligibility, miles, status, and other relevant data.\n   \n2. **Round Trip Booking**:\n   - **Outbound and Return Flights**: The system should allow the booking of both the outbound and return flights, ensuring that the passenger’s FF# is applied to both segments.\n   - **Miles or Points**: If applicable, the system should credit miles or points for both legs of the trip, based on the passenger’s membership tier, class of service, and any promotions that may apply.\n   \n3. **Apply FF# Benefits**: If the passenger is eligible for any specific benefits (priority boarding, lounge access, upgrades, etc.), the system should automatically apply them for both flights.\n\n4. **Manage Refund and Changes**: The system should link the FF# to both legs of the round trip so that if there is a need for modifications or cancellations, both the outbound and return flights are updated together as part of the same round trip. Refund policies should apply to both flights according to the frequent flyer’s status.\n\n5. **Special Requests or Upgrades**: If the passenger has requested any special services (e.g., extra baggage, upgrade, etc.), the system should ensure these requests are processed for both flights.\n\n6. **Mileage Accrual and Tracking**: Ensure that both flights (outbound and return) are tracked in the frequent flyer’s account, and any miles or points accrued from the trip are accurately reflected.\n\n7. **Ticketing and Pricing**: Ensure that the pricing reflects any discounts or offers available for frequent flyer members, and apply any special fare codes related to the FF#.\n\n8. **Provide Confirmation**: After booking, the system should send the passenger a confirmation of both the outbound and return flights, along with the benefits tied to their FF#.\n\nBy ensuring these steps are followed, the system would effectively manage the frequent flyer’s round trip, taking full advantage of the FF# benefits and maintaining the consistency of the booking process."
