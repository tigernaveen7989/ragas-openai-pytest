Here’s how it generally works:\n\n1. **Individual Benefits**: Each passenger receives the benefits associated with their own frequent flyer tier. For example, if one passenger is Gold and the other is Silver, the Gold member will receive Gold benefits (e.g., priority boarding, extra baggage allowance), while the Silver member will receive Silver benefits.\n\n2. **Shared Benefits**: Some benefits may extend to companions traveling on the same reservation, depending on the airline's policy. For instance:\n   - **Lounge Access**: Some airlines allow elite members to bring a companion into the lounge, regardless of the companion's tier.\n   - **Priority Services**: Priority boarding or check-in may apply to the entire party if the elite member is traveling with others on the same booking.\n\n3. **Baggage Allowance**: Each passenger’s baggage allowance is typically based on their individual tier status. For example, the Gold member might get two free checked bags, while the Silver member gets one.\n\n4. **Seat Selection**: Elite members may enjoy complimentary seat selection, but this usually applies only to their own seat, not to companions unless explicitly stated by the airline.\n\n5. **Upgrades**: Upgrade eligibility is usually tied to the individual’s tier status. If one passenger is eligible for an upgrade, it typically does not extend to the companion unless the airline has a specific policy allowing it.\n\nAlways check the specific airline's policy, as rules can vary. If you have a particular airline in mind, let me know, and I can provide more detailed information!", 'status': 'success'}[0m
