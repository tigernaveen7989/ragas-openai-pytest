INFO     pytest_logger:ironman.py:62 {'response': 'In a two-passenger one-way scenario with frequent flyer (FF) numbers, the following typically happens:\n\n1. **Booking Process**: Both passengers are booked on the same one-way flight. During the booking process, each passenger’s FF number is entered to ensure they earn miles or points for the flight.\n\n2. **Mileage Accrual**: Each passenger earns miles or points based on their individual FF accounts. The miles are credited according to the airline’s earning rules, which may depend on factors like fare class, distance flown, or elite status.\n\n3. **Separate Accounts**: The miles earned are credited to each passenger’s FF account separately. There is no automatic pooling or sharing of miles unless explicitly allowed by the airline’s program rules.\n\n4. **Elite Qualification**: If applicable, the flight contributes to each passenger’s elite qualification progress (e.g., status miles, segments, or points) in their respective FF programs.\n\n5. **Seat Assignments and Services**: Both passengers receive their own seat assignments and any associated services (e.g., baggage allowance, priority boarding) based on their individual tickets and FF status.\n\nIn summary, each passenger’s FF number ensures they receive individual benefits and mileage accrual for the one-way flight, with no automatic sharing between the two passengers.', 'status': 'success'}
