When seats or ancillaries such as baggage, meals, or seat selections are chargeable but discounted, it means they are optional add-ons offered at a lower price than the standard rate. Airlines provide such discounts to encourage customers to purchase additional services. The discounted price is applied on top of the base fare, allowing passengers to save money while still opting for extra services. These promotions are often part of loyalty benefits or sales campaigns, giving passengers flexibility and value while enabling the airline to increase ancillary revenue.
