[32m[INFO][0m [35m[10-11-2025 14:09:00][0m [36mironman.py:62[0m : [30m{'response': 'In airline frequent flyer programs, tier benefits for groups (like families or companions) typically prioritize the highest tier among the passengers for shared perks, but individual benefits are applied to the qualifying member. Benefits like partner miles, lounge access, or upgrades are often prorated or limited based on each passenger\'s eligibility. Policies vary by airline, so always check the specific program\'s terms. Here\'s a breakdown for major U.S. airlines based on their rules:\n\n- **Delta SkyMiles**: Benefits like Sky Club access or complimentary upgrades are offered to the eligible passenger, but group bookings may allow the highest-tier member to select preferred seats first. If different tiers, free snacks/beverages or boarding priority go to the higher-tier passenger(s), not the group as a whole (Delta\'s conditions).\n\n- **United MileagePlus**: Premier-tier passengers can clear the upgrade list for the group at a faster rate if traveling together. Lounge access and boarding depend on each passenger\'s status; for example, a Premier Plus passenger can\'t access Polaris lounges if traveling with a basic member. Awards for group travel (e.g., complimentary awards) are based on the lowest eligible tier (United\'s Premier & MileagePlus XFAQ).\n\n- **American Airlines AAdvantage**: Elite qualifications for perks like additional bags or preferred seating are individual. For AAdvantage award seats, benefits like preferred seating can be claimed by each eligible passenger, but overall award pricing considers the highest tier for co-passengers in mixed-status groups (AAdvantage terms and conditions).\n\nFor evidence, these rules are outlined in each airline\'s official program guides (e.g., Delta\'s, United\'s, AA\'s websites, updated as of 2023–2024). If two passengers have different tiers, the lower-tier one won\'t "inherit" the full higher-tier perks unless specified (rarely), to prevent abuse of the program. For international flights or partners, consult the airline directly.', 'status': 'success'}[0m
