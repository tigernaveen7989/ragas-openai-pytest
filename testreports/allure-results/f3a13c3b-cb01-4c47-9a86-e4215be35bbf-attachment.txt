  "When adding seats or ancillaries (additional services or products) to an existing order, the following steps and considerations should typically occur:\n\n1. **Verify Order Eligibility**:  \n   - Ensure the existing order can be modified. Some orders may have restrictions based on the product, service, or timing (e.g., close to the delivery/event date).\n\n2. **Check Availability**:  \n   - Confirm that the additional seats or ancillaries are available. For example, in events or flights, seating capacity or specific services may be limited.\n\n3. **Update Pricing**:  \n   - Calculate and display the additional cost for the seats or ancillaries. Ensure the pricing is transparent and includes any taxes or fees.\n\n4. **Apply Discounts (if applicable)**:  \n   - If the customer is eligible for discounts (e.g., loyalty program, promotional codes), apply them to the additional items.\n\n5. **Update Order Summary**:  \n   - Provide a revised order summary showing the original order, the new additions, and the updated total cost.\n\n6. **Payment Processing**:  \n   - If the additions require additional payment, securely process the transaction. If the customer has a saved payment method, confirm before charging.\n\n7. **Confirmation and Receipt**:  \n   - Send a confirmation email or notification with the updated order details, including the new seats or ancillaries.\n\n8. **Inventory Management**:  \n   - Update the inventory or booking system to reflect the changes, ensuring the added seats or services are reserved.\n\n9. **Customer Support**:  \n   - Provide clear instructions on how to access or use the added seats/ancillaries (e.g., new tickets, service vouchers).\n\n10. **Cancellation/Refund Policy**:  \n    - Inform the customer of any changes to the cancellation or refund policy due to the additions.\n\nBy following these steps, the process remains seamless, transparent, and customer-friendly."
