  "In general, “free” means there’s no charge to the passenger for that item and it’s treated as included in the fare or as a courtesy/loyalty entitlement. Key points:\n\n- Free seat:\n  - The seat is reserved or assigned at no extra cost.\n  - The passenger’s itinerary shows the seat as Included or 0 price.\n  - No additional revenue is recognized for that seat; inventory is still tracked (you can still upgrade later if allowed).\n\n- Free ancillary (baggage, meals, priority, etc.):\n  - The entitlement is included in the fare or earned via loyalty/promotions.\n  - The passenger can use the service without paying extra; if they opt for something beyond the included entitlements, charges apply.\n  - Accounting/revenue reporting typically treats included ancillaries as part of the base fare (no separate ancillary revenue for that item).\n\n- What to watch for:\n  - Promotions and eligibility: ensure the passenger qualifies (status, promo codes, route, time window).\n  - If the passenger later selects a paid option (e.g., a paid seat with better legroom), the system should apply the upgrade fee and adjust entitlements accordingly.\n  - Accurate inventory and reporting: mark items as included 0-price and avoid double-charging.\n\nExample: A traveler buys a fare that includes free seat selection. The system marks seat 12A as Included, no seat-charge is billed. If later they upgrade to a paid premium seat, the upgrade fee is charged and the entitlement changes."
