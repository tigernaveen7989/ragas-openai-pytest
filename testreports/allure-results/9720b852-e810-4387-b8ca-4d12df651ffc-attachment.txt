In a **two-passenger one-way scenario** involving **frequent flyer (FF) numbers**, here are some key points to consider:

1. **Accrual of Miles**: Each passenger will accrue their own miles based on their individual frequent flyer accounts. You cannot combine miles from two different accounts for the same flight.

2. **FF Number Usage**: You can only credit the flight to one frequent flyer program per segment. If you want to use different FF numbers for different segments, you may need to adjust this after the flight.

3. **Check-in Process**: Each traveler must check in separately, as they cannot share a seat or check-in under the same FF number.

4. **Booking Tips**: It's advisable to have a frequent flyer account set up before booking to ensure you can earn miles for your flight.
