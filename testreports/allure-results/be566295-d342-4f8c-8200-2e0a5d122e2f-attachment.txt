['**Rest Assured** is a Java library that simplifies the process of testing and automating RESTful web services. It provides a fluent, readable API for sending HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and asserting responses—status codes, headers, body content, JSON or XML structures, and even schema validation. By integrating Rest Assured into test frameworks like TestNG or Cucumber, you can write maintainable, end‑to‑end API tests that run automatically as part of your continuous‑integration pipeline.']
