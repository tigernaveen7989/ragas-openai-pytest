For a round trip with a single passenger and a frequent flyer number (FF#), the system should generally perform the following steps:

1. **Verify the FF#**: Ensure the frequent flyer number is valid and correctly associated with the passenger's account.

2. **Check for Applicable Benefits**: The system should check if the frequent flyer number qualifies for any benefits, such as upgrades, priority boarding, or special services on both outbound and return legs of the trip.

3. **Track the Round Trip**: The system should log the round trip as a single journey, associating both the outbound and return flights with the same passenger and FF#. This ensures that the system tracks the total miles or segments flown.

4. **Accrue Miles/Points**: The system should automatically calculate and accrue any points or miles based on the passenger's frequent flyer status and the distance flown for both legs of the round trip.

5. **Manage Seat Selection**: If the frequent flyer benefits include priority seating or special seat selection, the system should offer or automatically assign seats accordingly on both legs of the round trip.

6. **Update Status**: If applicable, update the passenger's frequent flyer status based on the miles flown during the round trip. This may impact eligibility for future benefits, upgrades, or tier changes.

7. **Send Confirmation**: The system should send a confirmation with all details (flights, FF# benefits, mileage accrual, etc.) to the passenger, clearly indicating it is a round trip.

8. **Handle Flight Changes or Cancellations**: If changes or cancellations occur for either leg of the round trip, the system should properly associate those changes with the original FF# and ensure any associated benefits or mileage are adjusted accordingly.

In summary, the system should treat the round trip as a unified journey while ensuring that the frequent flyer number is properly applied to both flights, offering benefits and tracking the necessary information for future loyalty status updates.
