This ensures that the system tracks the total miles or segments flown.\n\n4. **Accrue Miles/Points**: The system should automatically calculate and accrue any points or miles based on the passenger's frequent flyer status and the distance flown for both legs of the round trip.\n\n5. **Manage Seat Selection**: If the frequent flyer benefits include priority seating or special seat selection, the system should offer or automatically assign seats accordingly on both legs of the round trip.\n\n6. **Update Status**: If applicable, update the passenger's frequent flyer status based on the miles flown during the round trip. This may impact eligibility for future benefits, upgrades, or tier changes.\n\n7. **Send Confirmation**: The system should send a confirmation with all details (flights, FF# benefits, mileage accrual, etc.) to the passenger, clearly indicating it is a round trip.\n\n8. **Handle Flight Changes or Cancellations**: If changes or cancellations occur for either leg of the round trip, the system should properly associate those changes with the original FF# and ensure any associated benefits or mileage are adjusted accordingly.\n\nIn summary, the system should treat the round trip as a unified journey while ensuring that the frequent flyer number is properly applied to both flights, offering benefits and tracking the necessary information for future loyalty status updates.", 'status': 'success'}[0m
