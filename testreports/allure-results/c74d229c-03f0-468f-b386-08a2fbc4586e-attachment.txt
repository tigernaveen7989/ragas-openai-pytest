The Seat Map & Ancillary Offers feature with Frequent Flyer Tier Benefits is meant to combine seating visualization with personalized perks and offers tied to your loyalty status.

Key purposes:
- Help you choose seats while showing what you’re entitled to through your Frequent Flyer Tier (e.g., free or discounted seat selection, priority services).
- Surface relevant ancillary offers (baggage, meals, Wi‑Fi, lounge access, upgrades, etc.) that you can bundle with your seat.
- Personalize pricing and perks based on your tier, so you see the best value for your membership level.
- Encourage easier, one‑flow upsell: you can add seats and ancillaries in one checkout, with your tier benefits automatically applied.

Benefits to you:
- Clear visibility of what your tier provides at the moment of seat choice.
- Potential savings through tier‑based perks and bundled offers.
- A faster, simpler checkout with relevant add‑ons.

Benefits to the airline:
- Targeted upsell and higher ancillary revenue.
- Strengthened loyalty through visible, tier‑based value.
- Better seat utilization by presenting compelling, personalized options.

If you’d like, I can tailor this explanation to your specific airline or loyalty program.
