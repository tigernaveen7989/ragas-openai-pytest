The **Seat Map & Ancillary Offers** feature, when integrated with **Frequent Flyer Tier Benefits**, serves multiple purposes to enhance the travel experience for loyal customers while driving additional revenue for airlines. Here’s a breakdown of its purpose:

1. **Personalized Experience for Frequent Flyers**:  
   - Allows airlines to offer tier-specific benefits (e.g., free seat selection, priority seating, or discounted upgrades) directly on the seat map, tailored to the customer’s loyalty status.  
   - Enhances customer satisfaction by recognizing and rewarding loyalty.

2. **Upselling and Cross-Selling Opportunities**:  
   - Displays ancillary offers (e.g., extra legroom seats, lounge access, or baggage upgrades) alongside the seat map, encouraging frequent flyers to purchase additional services.  
   - Leverages the customer’s willingness to spend more for a better travel experience.

3. **Increased Revenue Generation**:  
   - Encourages higher-tier frequent flyers to spend more on premium services, boosting ancillary revenue.  
   - Maximizes the value of loyalty programs by tying benefits to additional purchases.

4. **Streamlined Booking Process**:  
   - Integrates tier benefits and ancillary offers into a single, user-friendly interface, making it easier for customers to see and select options.  
   - Reduces friction during the booking process, improving conversion rates.

5. **Strengthening Customer Loyalty**:  
   - Reinforces the value of the loyalty program by showcasing exclusive benefits and offers.  
   - Encourages customers to maintain or upgrade their tier status for continued perks.

In summary, this feature combines the benefits of loyalty programs with ancillary sales, creating a win-win situation for both airlines and frequent flyers.
