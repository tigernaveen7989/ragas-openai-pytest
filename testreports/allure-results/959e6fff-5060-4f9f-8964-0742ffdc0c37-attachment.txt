The question is whether their trips can be combined on one vehicle without violating constraints (time, comfort, etc.).\n\n- FF numbers likely measure how compatible or profitable it is to merge the trips (e.g., lower FF = easy/beneficial to share; higher FF = unlikely or costly).\n\nWhat happens depending on FF:\n- If FF indicates high compatibility (low FF value):\n  - The trips are merged into a single route.\n  - Pickup order is chosen to minimize detours (often the closer origin is picked up first).\n  - The vehicle drops off passengers in an order that respects their destinations and minimizes total travel time/distance.\n  - The total cost/time for both passengers is typically lower than two separate trips, assuming detours are acceptable.\n\n- If FF indicates moderate compatibility:\n  - A partial merge might occur (shared leg from a common segment) with separate legs toward the final destinations.\n  - One passenger might be dropped off before the other if it shortens the route; or one trip might be split to maintain service quality.\n\n- If FF indicates low compatibility (high FF value):\n  - Trips stay separate; two distinct rides are scheduled.\n  - No sharing detour is introduced; each passenger gets a direct or near-direct ride.\n\nHow you’d evaluate it in practice:\n- Define origins and destinations: O1 -> D1, O2 -> D2.\n- Compute potential merged route and any detours required.\n- Apply FF to judge whether the merge saves time/distance and whether detours stay within acceptable limits for both passengers.\n- Choose the option (shared route vs. separate trips) that minimizes total cost/time while meeting constraints (wait time, maximum detour, comfort).\n\nIf you can tell me what FF stands for in your context and what system you’re modeling, I can tailor the explanation and give a concrete example.', 'status': 'success'}[0m
