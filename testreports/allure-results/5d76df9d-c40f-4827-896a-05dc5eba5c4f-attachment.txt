  "If seats or other ancillaries are chargeable but discounted, the customer still pays the discounted amount. Here’s what that implies:\n\n- What the customer pays: the final price is the discounted amount, not the list price.\n- Revenue impact: the airline recognizes revenue equal to the discounted price; the discount is recorded as a contra-revenue (a reduction from gross revenue).\n- Taxes/fees: typically apply to the amount charged (the discounted price). rules can vary by jurisdiction, so check local tax rules if needed.\n- Cancellations/changes: refunds usually reflect the actual amount paid (the discounted price). if the ticket/service is non-refundable, you still retain the discount as per policy.\n- Loyalty programs: points/miles rules vary—some programs base earn on the amount paid after discount, others on base fare or eligible spend as defined by the program.\n- Display and policy: discounts should be clearly shown to avoid consumer protection issues; terms may restrict stacking or applicability to certain items.\n- Promotions: many discounts aren’t stackable and have eligibility constraints.\n\nIf you tell me the context (pricing model, accounting framework like IFRS 15/ASC 606, or a specific airline policy), I can tailor the guidance."
