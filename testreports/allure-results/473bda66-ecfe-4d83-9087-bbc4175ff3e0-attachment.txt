When two passengers traveling together have different frequent flyer tiers, each passenger typically receives benefits according to their individual tier level. For example, a Gold member receives Gold-tier perks, while a Silver member receives Silver-tier benefits. However, for shared benefits such as lounge access, some airlines may allow a higher-tier passenger to extend access to a companion depending on their policy.
