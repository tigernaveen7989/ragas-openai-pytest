INFO     pytest_logger:ironman.py:62 {'response': "The **Seat Map & Ancillary Offers** feature, when tied to **Frequent Flyer Tier Benefits**, serves multiple purposes aimed at enhancing the travel experience for frequent flyers. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Seat Map**: \n   - This feature allows frequent flyer members (especially those in higher tiers) to **select their preferred seats** in advance. Often, the more frequent and loyal travelers have the ability to **choose better seats**, such as **extra legroom** or **premium seats**, without additional charges, depending on their tier.\n   - In addition, the **seat map** may show **available seats in real-time** and could offer early access to premium seating options, ensuring the best experience for members.\n\n2. **Ancillary Offers**: \n   - **Ancillary offers** include various paid services that enhance the flight experience, such as **lounge access**, **priority boarding**, **extra baggage allowance**, **Wi-Fi** access, or **in-flight entertainment**.\n   - **Frequent flyer tiers** often receive discounts, complimentary access, or **priority booking** for these additional services. Higher-tier members may receive more exclusive or extensive offers as part of their loyalty benefits, incentivizing travelers to reach and maintain a higher frequent flyer status.\n\nIn short, this feature is designed to **reward loyal customers** with **premium seating choices** and **enhanced services**, making their flight more comfortable and convenient. For airlines, it's a way to **boost customer retention** and enhance the loyalty program experience. \n\nDo you travel often, or are you exploring frequent flyer programs? 😊✈️", 'status': 'success'}
