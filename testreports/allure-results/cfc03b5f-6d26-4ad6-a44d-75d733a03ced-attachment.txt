- Real-time inventory validation: the modification flow checks live seat maps and ancillary inventories (baggage, seats, extra services) against the airline’s inventory system/GDS.

- Pricing and rule validation: the engine re-applies fare rules, eligibility, taxes/fees, and the ancillary catalog to ensure the offered price and products are valid for the new itinerary and passenger.

- Transactional guardrails: if availability or pricing cannot be confirmed or violated, the offer is rejected or updated before confirming the modification.

In short: live inventory + fare/ancillary rule validation (often via a rules engine and API/GDS integration) ensures accuracy during modifications.
