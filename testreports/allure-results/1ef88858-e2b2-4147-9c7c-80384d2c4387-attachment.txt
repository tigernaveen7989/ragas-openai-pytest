When two passengers traveling together have different frequent flyer tiers, the tier benefits are typically applied individually based on each passenger's status. Here’s how it generally works:

1. **Individual Benefits**: Each passenger receives the benefits associated with their own frequent flyer tier. For example, if one passenger is Gold and the other is Silver, the Gold member will receive Gold benefits (e.g., priority boarding, extra baggage allowance), while the Silver member will receive Silver benefits.

2. **Shared Benefits**: Some benefits may extend to companions traveling on the same reservation, depending on the airline's policy. For instance, priority boarding or lounge access might be extended to companions, but this varies by airline and tier level.

3. **Baggage Allowance**: Baggage allowances are usually applied individually. Each passenger gets the baggage allowance corresponding to their tier, regardless of the other passenger's status.

4. **Seat Selection**: Seat selection benefits (e.g., preferred seating) are typically applied individually, though some airlines may allow companions to sit together in preferred seating areas if available.

5. **Upgrades**: Upgrade eligibility is usually based on individual tier status. If one passenger is eligible for an upgrade, it won’t automatically extend to the other unless the airline has a specific policy for companions.

6. **Lounge Access**: Lounge access is often a personal benefit tied to the individual's tier. Some airlines may allow companions to enter the lounge for a fee or if the higher-tier member has guest privileges.

Always check the specific policies of the airline in question, as rules can vary significantly. If you have a particular airline in mind, let me know, and I can provide more detailed information!
