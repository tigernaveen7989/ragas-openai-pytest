['Jenkins is a continuous‑integration/continuous‑delivery (CI/CD) server that automates the building, testing, and deployment of software. It pulls code from version‑control systems (e.g., GitHub), runs build tools (Maven, npm, Gradle), executes test suites (Appium, Playwright, API tests), collects reports (Extent, Log4J2), and deploys artifacts to repositories or servers. Jenkins also orchestrates parallel test execution, manages build pipelines via Jenkinsfiles, and triggers downstream jobs or deployments, enabling fast, repeatable delivery of code changes.']
