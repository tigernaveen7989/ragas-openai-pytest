If you're referring to airline seat assignments or ancillaries (like extra baggage, meals, or upgrades), which are often subject to fees, here's a straightforward explanation based on common airline policies (e.g., from carriers like Delta, American Airlines, or United):

### Key Points:
- **Chargeable**: This means the item isn't free and requires payment. Standard seats assigned by the airline are often free, but premium seats (e.g., exit rows, extra legroom) are typically chargeable as "preferred" or "assigned" seats.
- **Discounted**: Airlines frequently offer promotional discounts on these chargeable items, especially for loyalty program members, certain fare classes (like basic economy tickets that might qualify for reduced fees), or sales. The discount applies to the base chargeable price, reducing what you pay—e.g., a $50 seat might be discounted to $30.
  
### What Happens?
- **You Still Pay, But Less**: The service or seat requires a fee, but at the discounted rate. This isn't free—it's just cheaper than the standard chargeable price. For example, if an airline runs a promotion on ancillaries, you'd pay the reduced amount during booking or later if selecting post-purchase.
- **Conditions Apply**: Discounts are usually time-limited, tied to specific programs, or may have restrictions (e.g., non-refundable if canceled). Always check the airline's terms, as policies vary.
- **Refunds or Changes**: If you qualify for a discount but cancel, the refunded amount would reflect the discounted price paid (minus any fees). For instance, Delta allows changes on discounted seats but may waive fees for elites, while basic discounts cancel at no cost within the promotion window.

Check the specific airline's website or app for details on your booking, as rules differ by carrier and promotion. If this is about a different context (e.g., accounting or taxes), clarify for more tailored info!
