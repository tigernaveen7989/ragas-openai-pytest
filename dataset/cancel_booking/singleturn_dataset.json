    "reference":"VA would like to implement an additional option called 'Cancel Under Fare Rule Conditions' within the ticket Void Period, which is typically allowed within 24 hours after ticketing. This option would enable agents to either void the ticket due to their mistake or cancel the ticket under fare conditions in case of a customer's mistake. The conditions for canceling an order item state that the most restrictive refundability rules apply when a changed order item is subsequently canceled, which emphasizes the need for flexibility in ticket management.",
