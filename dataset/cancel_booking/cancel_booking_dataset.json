Enter data here if applicable\n\nIs \/ Is not in Scope\n\nIn Scope Out of Scope applying the original refundability rules in case an exchange is ultimately refunded exchange with refund applying the most restrictive refundability rules  , the original or the exchange, when an exchange is ultimately refunded applies to air and non-air Order Reshop Cancel and Refund Exchanged on Host\/Cancel Cancel Air after one Air Exchange and Cancel Air after Subsequent Air exchanges Cancel on host after exchanged - sync scenarios should cover this use case Cancel EMD-A, EMD-S after air exchange, Cancel EMD-A after subsequent EMD-A exchange JSON and NDC API\n\nAnticipated or identified risks and dependencies\n\nWhat are business risks?​\n\n{Enter information here as applicable}\n\nWhat are project risks?​\n\n{Enter information here as applicable}\n\nWhat are external dependencies?\n\n{Enter information here as applicable}\n\nWhat are technical\/technology risk?\n\n{Enter information here as applicable}\n\nTeam(s) Involved\n\nDomain Team(s) Involved (Y or N) Offer -  Shopping Engine Offer - RMX Y Availability and Inventory Order Management\/APIs and Plugin's (OMS) Y SabreMosaic UI ?

    "reference":"The implementation of the 'Cancel Under Fare Rule Conditions' option enhances flexibility for travel agencies by allowing agents to choose between voiding a ticket due to their mistake or canceling it under fare conditions when the customer makes a mistake. This capability is particularly beneficial within the void period defined by the airline, as it provides users with multiple options: canceling under fare rules, voiding and retaining the ticket, or voiding and refunding the ticket. This flexibility helps travel agencies better manage cancellations and improve customer service.",
